	<h1>TFL Scam</h1>

	How TFL charged me 200% the real price of train ticket at told me to "**** off" afterwards! – Today I went to Gatwick Airport to pick up my mom. I bought a train ticket at a ticket machine at London Bridge Station: Standard Fare (use only FCC trains, shown as STD in top right corner of the attached ticket), Day Return, Off-Peak, London Bridge - Gatwick Airport. The price was £30. I assumed it's normal price and paid by card. After picking up mom from airport, I bought her one way ticket to London Bridge (now using FCC ticket machine), which was now only £10. That's strange, I thought. Went to speak to assistant, they said don't know who could have charged me that crazy price, because return ticket costs only £15. Ok, I went back to London Bridge station and talked to the personal in the ticket window. They said the ticket system sold me includes: 1) Going by TUBE to VICTORIA, 2) Taking return GATWICK EXPRESS from VICTORIA. -- WTF!!! There is direct train from London Bridge to Gatwick!!! I pointed out that the ticket is a standard fare (as evidenced by the STD mark in top right corner, and I am absolutely sure I chose "FCC trains only" when buying it). But the person in window just started ignoring me, and literally not answering anything. Ok, I went home, and on the way stopped by at Canary Wharf to see if the staff would be more assistive. Here is my conversation: Me: - Hi. I went to Gatwick from London Bridge today. Him: - Wonderful!!! (SERIOUSLY!!) Me: - And the system charged me £30 when the real price is £15. Him: - So what do you want? (LITERALLY!) Me: - I want to pay the fair price. Him: - We are not train, this is a ticket for train! (At this point he THROWS the ticket back from below the window, locks it, and starts looking behind me). Me: - But the ticket says "London Underground" on it... Him: Silence. Me: (Putting the ticket next to the glass so that it goes inside his field of view, sidewards from me) - You work in London Underground right? It sais here London Underground. Him: - This is our price then. Me: - But the real price is £15. Him: - (Looking up the price on the computer) See, it's £25! Me: Walking away... (Thinking: £25???? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
